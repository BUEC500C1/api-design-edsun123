For this api, I've created three functions: reply_to_tweet, print_colors, and print_objects

reply_to_tweet prints the label desriptions and tweets out the results
print_colors provides analytics on color composition in the terminal
print_colors detects all objects and gives probability of object detection on the terminal

To use the functions, I have a while loop that remains true but sleeps every 5 seconds for every tweet sent out. 
Change the function inside the while loop between reply_to_tweets, print colors, or print_objects
To send picture to the program, tweet to @Edwin86888730 with an image attached

email me at edsun@Bu.edu if errors occur
